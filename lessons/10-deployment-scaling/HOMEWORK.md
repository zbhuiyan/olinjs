### Before Class 11
#### Deploy to Heroku
If you didn't finish deploying an app to Heroku in class, please do so before next class. Heroku tutorials are linked in the [in-class exercises](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs/blob/master/lessons/10-deployment-scaling/INCLASS.md), and feel free to ask us for help by email or Slack if you have any questions.

**We do actually want to check that you completed this exercise. When you're done deploying your app, send an email containing your Heroku link to [olinjs16@gmail.com](olinjs16@gmail.com) with the subject line "Deployed App".**

#### Catch Up
Keep working on anything which is still in progress.
