#Lesson 10 - Intro to Deployment and Scaling

##Deploy to Heroku
**We do actually want to check that you completed this exercise. When you're done deploying your app, send an email containing your Heroku link to [olinjs16@gmail.com](olinjs16@gmail.com) with the subject line "Deployed App".**

Deploying your app allows you to share it with other Internet users. So far you've been accessing your apps at `localhost:PORT` -- which is great for development purposes, but not so great for sharing your app. Once you deploy an app, you'll be able to access it at a `something.heroku.com` URL (where `something` is the name you give your app during the deployment process).

**Before deploying your app, move it _out_ of your main Git repository into its own folder and run `git init` in the new folder! Deploying to Heroku requires your app directory to be a git repository, and nesting git repositories within git repositories gets kind of tricky.**

Sign up for a free Heroku account and work through the following two tutorials to deploy one of the apps you've written.

- [Adding a Remote MongoLab Database](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab)

##Catch Up & Synthesize
- Keep working on anything which is still in progress (we're here to help) 
- Look back through what you've learned so far and synthesize or review however is useful to you
