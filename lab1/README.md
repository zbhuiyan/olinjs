#Lab 1: WikiMVC

##Intro
This lab will have 2 components:
- Choosing a client-side Javascript framework and learning it
- Using that framework to construct a wiki clone with specified functionality

##Choosing a Framework
You may choose to learn a new framework, but we highly encourage you to keep using the framework you learned for the last assignment.

##Constructing a Wiki
You must construct a wikipedia-like clone using your chosen framework. You should program the app using the conventions, styles, and functionality of your chosen framework, show off what it can do. It should have the following functionality:
- Topic pages with title and content
- A list of all available pages
- Allow users to submit new pages on topics
- Allow users to edit existing pages
- Documentation for each major component (Minimum of few sentences at top of every file)
- Not look terrible
- One other feature you'd like to implement (anything from a random page button to images or html within content, or even a search bar. It's up to you to be creative!)

If you want to make the wiki have a special topic area (like harry potter or some game) you are encouraged to do so.
Brownie points will be awarded for awesome looking websites whose themes match the topic area, though having all the functionallity should come before making it pretty.
